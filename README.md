# Optimization-FOSSEE-project
Various optimization problems solved with five different optimization algorithms

- fminsearch optimization algorithm

Find minimum of unconstrained multivariable function using derivative-free method.

- fminbnd optimization algorithm

Find minimum of single-variable function on fixed interval.

- fsolve optimization algorithm

Solve system of nonlinear equations.

- intlinprog optimization algorithm

A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is a problem with:

Linear objective function, _f_T_x_, where _f_ is a column vector of constants, and _x_ is the column vector of unknowns. Bounds and linear constraints, but no nonlinear constraints Restrictions on some components of _x_ to have integer values

- Quadprog optimization algorithm

For Quadratic programming
